This is a collection of basic instructions for editing your unencrypted save game file.  
You can unencrypt your save file with (https://pentalex.github.io/COTL-SaveDecryptor/) written by [Pentalex](https://pentalex.github.io/) - Github [here](https://github.com/Pentalex/COTL-SaveDecryptor) if you want to validate it yourself.

I suggest Notepad++ and the JSTool plugin. Once you open your file you can run do Plugins > JSTool > JSFormat to get a cleaner looking JSON.
>* Before doing any of the following steps PLEASE BACKUP YOUR SAVE!
