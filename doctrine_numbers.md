# Doctrine Codes
This is a collection of all the doctrine numbers to be utilized with (https://pentalex.github.io/COTL-SaveDecryptor/) and a text editor.  
  
After getting your decrypted save file, search inside for **DoctrineUnlockedUpgrades** and edit the numbers within to set the doctrines you would like unlocked. Only use the numbers and not their description. Json formatting applies, so ( ##,##,## ) no comma after the last number.
>*Note: Some Doctrine upgrades are traits and a secondary location 'CultTraits' need to be modified as well which is listed below the primary marked preceding with CT:
>*Note2: Rituals require a replacement of the ritual Icon as well, they are replaced in 'UlockedUpgrades' and listed below each relevant one

#### EXAMPLE
To unlock all of the left branch of **Afterlife**, and the right branch of **Work & Worship** do this:  
"DoctrineUnlockedUpgrades":[30,32,34,36,11,7,9,13],

You dont have to unlock a full branch you can chose either side, but only one from each row.
>*Note: The left branch takes precedence over the right branch, so if you try using 30 and 31, you will only have 31 unlocked.*
